            <p>Tea is a drink prepared from the leaves of the <i>Camellia sinensis</i> plant, native to East Asia. 
               Originating in China, the drinking of tea has spread across the world, loved by many for the enjoyable taste and associated health benefits. It has become the most consumed beverage in the world, second only to water.

            <!-- <p>There are many types of tea, each with its own unique characterististics. 
               White teas have a light floral flavor, green teas can have a more bitter and grassy taste, 
               and black teas being more dark and earthy </p> -->

               <h2 id="otherHeading"> How Is Tea Made?</h2>
               <p id ="testP"> There are generally six categories of tea; white, yellow, green, oolong, black, and post-fermented. All this variety comes from the 
                  the processing of the <i>Camellia sinensis</i> plant.
                   Once leaves are harvested, they will begin to wilt and enzymes present in the leaves will begin to break down the chlorophyl. 
                   This releases tannins, creating a darker color, and also affecting the flavor of the tea.
               </p>
               <p class = "funParagraph">However, adding heat to the leaves will deactivate the enzymes, preventing them from carrying out the oxidation process.
                  With a variety of techniques, tea producers can control the oxidation process, and with it, a variety of tea.
               <!-- <p>White teas (the least oxidized) have a light floral flavor, green teas can have a more bitter and grassy taste, oolongs wih a nutty taste,
               and black teas (the most oxidized) being more dark and earthy </p> -->

                     <ul><b>White tea</b>: Unoxidized, features a delicate floral taste, and the lightest of colors. </ul>
                     <ul> <b>Yellow tea</b>: Unoxidized but allowed to yellow. Seen as a more mellow version of green tea, with none of its bitterness.</ul>
                     <ul> <b>Green tea</b>: Unoxidized, grassy and flowery tastes, can become bitter</ul>
                     <ul> <b>Oolong tea</b>: Lightly oxidized, but not as much as a black tea. Taste can range from sweeter to woody, roasted, and nutty</ul>
                     <ul> <b>Black tea</b>: Fully oxidized, generally with more dark, intense, and full-bodied flavors.</ul>
                     <ul> <b>Post-fermented tea</b>: Varient of tea that has been allowed to undergo a microbial fermentation, with a more earthy and mushroom-like taste</ul>
